# Analysis of Case Studies - Case Study 1

As part of your assignment submissions for the semester - you will choose
articles to read as a case study on particular topics.

The first case study occurs in week 3 of the semester, for the topic of
eugenics.  You will pick an article to read and complete the **annotation** and
**analysis** phase of the instrument.  The analysis phase will involve
considering the questions listed above for the entire document.  Short answers
should be supported by text and examples from the article.  Here is an example
analysis for an entire article.

## Case Study Example

**by Felicity A. Crawford**

*Phase 1*: Paper that was annotated (see Perusall):

Rushton, J.P. & Templer, D.T. (March 15, 2012). Do pigmentation and the
melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in
other animals? Personality and Individual Differences 53(2012) pp. 4 -8.
Elsevier.

*Phase 2*: Analysis (same reference as above)

1. What is the overall claim or idea made in this article?

    Dark skinned people are violent, aggressive, and hyper-sexualized: “We have
    found, in both humans and non-human animals, that darker pigmentation is
    associated with lower (IQ). Lighter pigmentation is associated with the slow
    reproductive strategy (K) including lower birth rates, less infant mortality,
    less violent crime, less HIV/AIDS, plus higher IQ, higher income, and greater
    longevity” Rushton & Templer, 2012, p.5).

2. Who is making the claim?

    The authors, J.P. Rushton and D.I. Templer, are psychologists from two
    universities in North America: University of Western Ontario & California School
    of Professional Psychology.

    Rushton was known for his racist views: “Whites have, on average, more neurons
    and cranial size than blacks… Blacks have an advantage in sport because they
    have narrower hips — but they have narrower hips because they have smaller
    brains.” --J. Philippe Rushton, speaking at the 2000 American Renaissance
    conference Templer was known for his ideas on race and intelligence and was a
    frequent speaker at white nationalist American Renaissance conferences. In one
    speech Templer said "the present problems of blacks have literally nothing to do
    with slavery, with segregation, or with lynching, and I wish they would shut up"

    Galileos' - YouTube". www.youtube.com. Retrieved September 22, 2021).

3. To whom is the claim applied? Is the target of the claim specified
explicitly, or implied?

    Dark-skinned people (Blacks): “The correlations between human pigmentation,
    aggression, and sexuality (and IQ), is further supported by the anthropological
    and sociological research on “pigmentocracies” …A pigmentocracy is a society in
    which status hierarchies are based largely on skin color, with lighter skin
    denoting higher status and darker skin, lower status” (p.4).

4. To whom is the claim being made? Is the intended audience clear?

    The scientific community. The paper was published in a major scientific journal,
    Personality, and Individual Differences

5. Does the claim implicitly or explicitly include or exclude certain groups? If
so, who? If not, what information do we have about the included/excluded groups?

    The claim explicitly excludes light-skinned people (Whites and Asians).
    According to the authors, “Blacks are overrepresented in crime statistics
    relative to Whites and Asians” (p.5)
