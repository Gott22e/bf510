# Synthesis

In the final phase you will use your now detailed understanding of the text to
produce a narrative exposition and interpretation. The purpose of this synthesis
is to contextualize the ideas and claims of the text through the lens of equity,
equality, and diversity. The synthesis should take the form of a short essay
framed by a “framing question” about the text, complete with argumentation and
citation of evidence to support your interpretation. Below are four example of
framing questions you may consider using:

* Have the ideas or claims of the text been conclusively confirmed or refuted by
other sources? If yes, how and by whom? If not, what uncertainty remains?
* Have or could any specific groups of people benefit or be harmed by the ideas
  or claims in the text? If yes, who and how?
* Does the text invoke or reinforce existing power structures (e.g. political,
  economic, etc) or hierarchies?
* Does the combination of the identity of the author, the intended audience, or
  the target subject groups of the text raise any concerns about conflicts of
  interest? If yes, what might be the consequences of those conflicts of
  interest, and for whom?

You may modify these questions as you see fit, or pose your own framing question
as you see fit.

Your synthesis should begin by stating the question you will address, followed
by a well structured essay describing any needed background information, a
description of your position, and references to other sources that support that
position. You may find the following guidelines for how to structure your essay
helpful.

| Step 0:        | State the framing question your synthesis will treat                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Step 1: (what) | Introduce the reader with a summary of the reading and a sentence (thesis) that sums up the central point of your essay                                                                                                                                  |
| Step 2: (what) | Identify and explain (with citations) the theories or core concepts that are required to understand your position                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 3: (how)  | Elaborate and substantiate your response to the framing question with arguments supported by citations to outside sources.                                                                                                                               |
| Step 4: (why)  | Interpretation:  What do you think now that you have read this text? Were you persuaded by this reading? Did you change your mind as a result of reading this text? How difficult did you find it to identify appropriate sources to form your position? |
