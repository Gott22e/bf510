# BF/BI510: The Instrument

“The Instrument” is a tool we are developing in this class to help identify
potentially hidden biases in a text.

## Background & Rationale

Claims made in texts, be they news, opinion, or scientific articles, always
presume some set of assumptions are true. These assumptions may be explicitly
stated within the text itself, or implicitly held by the author. In any case,
the validity or veracity of the assumptions underlying a claim are not always
obvious to the reader and require exploration and additional investigation to
elucidate. This process of gathering information to place a text in its broader
context to better understand it (sometimes called "deep", "slow", or "close"
reading) requires time and effort, and while several strategies have been
proposed, no formal or rigorous approaches to performing this type of reading
are broadly accepted.

The scientific method itself is a process that may be employed to systematize a
deep reading of a text. In scientific articles, important pieces of existing
evidence are annotated with citations that provide the basis for the validity of
a claim or assumption. However, while the same approach may be employed in
fields and contexts outside scientific publications, this convention of
explicitly citing prior evidence within a text is not as commonplace. It may be
unclear in a text that a claim requiring substantiation has even been made,
which statements are opinions vs facts, etc, thus making it difficult to know
which statements to investigate. An intuition and sensibility for "sniffing out"
aspects of a text that are biased or unsubstantiated may be developed with
practice.

Another key component of the scientific method is data. Generally speaking, data
are gathered using instruments that measure specific quantities in a
standardized way that allows them to be meaningfully compared. For example,
a ruler measures distance using a standardized scale, e.g. inches, such that any
measurement taken with a ruler of the same scale may be compared, regardless of
where or by whom the ruler is used.

It is a structured approach to reading a text that has the following phases:

1. **Annotate** -  label key words, phrases, or sentences with a controlled set
   of hashtags
2. **Analyze** - answer a set of short answer questions designed to identify key
   aspects of the text
3. **Synthesize** - write a short narrative reflection about the article guided
   by a set of scaffolding questions
